      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="container"> An American science fiction writer <strong>Robert Heinlein</strong> (full name is <strong>Robert Ansen Heinlein</strong>) was born on July 7, 1907 in Butler, Missouri in the family of <strong>Rex Ivor Heinlein</strong> and <strong>Bem Lyle Heinlein</strong>. Heinlein became the third. Besides him, there were six more children - three brothers and three sisters. Three years after his birth, the family moved to Kansas City (Missouri), where his father took a job in the Midland Agricultural Machinery Company. Heinlein's childhood was here.</p>
             
      <p class="container"> In 1920 Heinlein entered the Central High School of Kansas City. By this time he was very fond of astronomy, read all available books on the topic from the Kansas City Public Library. The writer's grandfather, <strong>Alva Lyle,</strong> also influenced his worldview and creativity. He instilled in him a love of reading and exact sciences, brought up a number of positive traits of character. </p>

      <p class="container"> He graduated from high school in Kansas City in 1924 and studied a year in college. His brother <strong>Rex Heinlein</strong> went to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, and Heinlein chose the same future for himself. He collected many recommendations and sent them to senator <strong>James Reed</strong>. In that time to enter the academy, it was necessary to enlist the support of one of the congressmen or senators. During this time, Senator Reed received a hundred letters from those wishing to enter the Annapolis Academy - fifty one from each person and fifty from Heinlein. Thus, the right to enter the academy was obtained and Heinlein in June 1925 became a cadet of the Academy after successfully passed the entrance examinations.  During the training at the academy, Heinlein practiced three times - on the battleships <em>"Utah", "Oklahoma"</em> and <em>"Arkansas</em>. In 1929, Heinlein successfully finished his studies in the rankings of the two-hundred and forty-three cadets of the issue and was awarded the title of <em>Ensign</em>. After the academy, Heinlein was assigned to a new aircraft carrier of the US Navy, <em>Lexington</em>, the first American aircraft carrier. In the middle of 1932 he was promoted to junior lieutenant and transferred to destroyer USS Roper. However, at the end of 1933 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and had to resign. 7 December 1941, after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Heinlein applied for active service, but was turned down on medical grounds - the policy of the naval department did not restore the victims of tuberculosis.</p>
         
          <p class="container">     
          Soon after his resignation, Heinlein became interested in policy. He joined the movement of <strong>E. Sinclair</strong> under the slogan <em>"Ending poverty in California!"</em> (EPIC), popular in the early 1930s in California, becoming by 1935 the  secretary of the district assembly of the movement and a member of the commission for the constitution of the EPIC. When Sinclair was running as governor of the Democratic Party, Heinlein actively participated in this unsubstantiated campaign. In 1938, he himself ran for the California Legislative Assembly, but again failed.</p>

      </div>
      
      <p class="container"> Over a four-day period in early April 1939, Heinlein wrote the story <em>“Life-Line”</em>. He sent it to <strong>John W. Campbell Jr</strong>., at <em>ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</em>. Later Heinlein had sent half a dozen more stories to Campbell, which were rejected (and ultimately sold to lesser markets)— but Campbell did buy another story, <em>“Misfit”</em> and in quick succession published a pivotal series of stories — <em>“Requiem</em>”, <em>“If This Goes On —”</em>, <em>“The Roads Must Roll”,</em> <em>“Coventry”,</em> and a story that predicted the atomic weaponry and explored the dynamics of the Cold War (in 1940!), <em>“Blowups Happen”.</em>  In the Second World War Heinlein was drafted from the reserve for military service. After - on the order of the publishing house <b>Scribner</b> - he begins to write fiction for teenagers. This period is considered the most fruitful. Since 1947, he has written eleven novels only of this cycle - <em>"Galileo Rocket Ship",</em> <em>"Space Cadet",</em> <em>"Red Planet",</em> <em>"Farmer in the Sky"</em>, <em>"Between Planets",</em> <em>"The Space Family of the Stones",</em> <em>"Starry Sailor Johns",</em> <em>"Tunnel in the sky",</em> <em>"Star beast",</em> <em>"Time for the stars",</em> <em>"There will be a spacesuit - there will be travel."</em>  At that time, Heinlein worked with <strong>Isaac Asimov</strong> and <strong>L. Sprague de Camp</strong> at the Naval Research Laboratory in Philadelphia. They developed methods to combat icing of aircraft at high altitudes, equipment for blind landing and compensating hermetic suits. Here Heinlein met his future wife - <strong>Virginia Doris Gerstenfeld</strong>. In 1948 they got married.</p>
      
      <p class="container"> In 1953-1954, the Heinleins couple made their first round-the-world trip, the impression of which indirectly affected his travel novels (like the <em>"Martian Podkane"</em>). In 1959-1960 they visited the USSR, for the sake of which Virginia studied the Russian language for two years. However, it was at that time when the US reconnaissance U-2 spy plane was shot down over the territory of the USSR, which ultimately affected Heinlein's relations with the Soviet Union. </p>
      
      <p class="container"> Isaac Asimov believed that marrying Virginia also means changing the political priorities of Heinlein. Together they founded the League of Patrick Henry, and in 1964 actively participated in the election campaign of <b>Barry Goldwater</b>. (In Heinlein's archive there are also two great apologies of <b>McCarthy</b>). However, Heinlein can not be considered an orthodox conservative: during this period he for the first time openly tries to unite his libertinism with traditional law. Heinlein became a consistent fighter with prejudices and therefore was extremely negative about any attempts to classify his ideology (including libertarianism) </p>
      
      <p class="container"> Beginning in 1961, he published books that radically expanded the boundaries of science fiction. This period includes works such as <em>"Stranger In a Foreign Country"</em> (1961), <em>"The Moon Is a Harsch Mistress"</em> (1966), which is considered the peak of his work.</p>
      
      <p class="container"> The 70's began badly for Heinlein. Because of the hard work, the writer fell ill with peritonitis, and vacation in Tahiti in 1978 ended in a severe attack of coronary heart disease for him. He underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. Despite the heavy self-esteem, the writer continued to write. In 1973 there was a novel <em>"Time Enough for Love: The Lives of Lazarus Long"</em> </p>
      
      <p class="container"> In the 1980s, he wrote five more novels, and also prepared for publication a collection called the <em>"Extended Universe"</em>. In 1983, the writer visited Antarctica, the last continent that he had not visited yet. </p>
      
      <p class="container"> On the morning of May 8, 1988, Heinlein died at home, the city of Carmel, from the effects of emphysema. He did not have time to finish his last novel from the series <em>"The World as a Myth"</em>. His body was cremated, and ashes scattered over the Pacific Ocean. </p>

      <p class="container"> During his lifetime Heinlein published <strong>32</strong> books and a lot of stories. Heinlein became the first professional science fiction writer in the United States and one of the first to publish in major popular publications. He became the only writer who received <em>"Hugo"</em> for five novels. In his honor the asteroid and the crater on Mars are named. </p>
      <p class="container"> In 2003, the organization responsible for Heinlein's heritage preservation established nominal award, which is awarded for writing works that inspire people to explore outer space. There is also a literary prize, named for the hero of the story <em>"Green Hills of the Earth"</em> - an astronaut who lost his sight, but not cosmos and became a cosmic bard - awarded for the best fantastic work written in poetic form.  </p>
